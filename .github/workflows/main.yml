# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the master branch
  push:
    branches: 
      - main
      - "releases/**"
      - master
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # 拉取 github 仓库代码
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      # 设定 node 环境
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
          # 设置发包 npm 地址仓库
          registry-url: https://registry.npmjs.org
      # 安装依赖，相当于 npm ci
      - name: Install dependencies 📦️
        run: npm install
      # 执行构建步骤
      - name: 构建
        run: |
          npm run build
      # 执行部署
      - run: npm publish

          NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{secrets.NPM_TOKEN}}
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: echo Hello, world!

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
      - name: Run a multi-line script
        run: |
          echo Add other actions to build,
          echo test, and deploy your project.
